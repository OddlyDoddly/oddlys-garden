# Oddly's Garden 🌱

My personal tech notebook built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

**Live Site:** https://oddlydoddly.github.io/oddlys-garden/

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Local Development

```bash
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window at `http://localhost:3000/oddlys-garden/`. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

This site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions when changes are pushed to the `main` branch. No manual deployment is needed!

The workflow file is located at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
