# The Garden Opens
### 2025-11-21 11:52 AM EST

Today I have begun the initial setup of my new home network infrastructure. I am planning on using docusaurus to log my persona journal as well as keep track
of design documents and thoughts as I develop my network and AI with tools to help me manage my life as a software engineer. I have plans to utilize this platform
to keep track of different design documents I have for different software, as well as just my general thoughts.

I figured Docusaurus and nvim would make for a perfect markdown notebook for me where I can host my work on github pages without every having to worry about losing
it or hosting it myself.
