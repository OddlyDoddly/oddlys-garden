# Philosophy of Philosophy
## Philosophy as a framework for life

I think the dictionary does a really bad job at defining philosophy in a way that reflects how we actually use the word in everyday language. It tries to define it in strictly scholarly terms, and it always circles back to that “fun” little problem philosophers love defining philosophy itself, often done through means of over-glorifying philosophy all together. “What is philosophy?”

It’s hard to explain my own perspective on philosophy without first pointing out that I’m not pretending there’s an objective definition of the word. “What is philosophy?” isn’t a philosophical problem to me, it’s a linguistic one. You can’t answer that question objectively without asking whether there’s some universal deciding factor that gives any word its meaning. We use the same sound to express different meanings not only across languages, but even within one language.

The point I’m making is that language is subjective. And while I’ll argue in these pages that some things are purely objective, many of the philosophies I choose are rooted in personal, relative, or subjective values. My definition of philosophy, and the way I use it, is personal. What “philosophy” means to one person may be totally different to another.

In the context of my writings here, every page begins with “Philosophy of,” because I think of philosophy as a process of creating processes. I take this from how we naturally use the word:

“I have a philosophy for living.”
“I have a philosophy for cleaning.”
“He has a philosophy for organization.”
“She has a philosophy of writing.”

To me, philosophy is “a way of going about doing something,” or “a method for approaching a particular task or subject.” In this article, I’m explaining my philosophy of philosophy: I use it to create methods for premeditating my responses to aspects of life in relation to certain truths about it.

## Truth, Perspective & Language

I don’t treat truth as something mystical, the way many past philosophers did. I’d like to think I’m a bit like Nietzsche on this subject, though maybe more structured in how I think about relativity. I don’t deny that objective truths exist, and I won’t deny their central importance in philosophy for millennia. But my relationship to truth is tied more to its evolutionary usefulness than to any grand search for a “theory of everything”—that role belongs more to physics today.

I’ll reserve a full section for my philosophies of truth and epistemology, but I can’t write about my philosophy of philosophy without touching on my relationship to truth and how I use it. Most philosophers in history approached questions like truth, life, and death as if the answers would be handed to them by the external world. But questions like “What is love?”, “What is truth?”, “What is life?”, “What is death?” are, at the base level, linguistic questions—not inherently philosophical ones. Though, by my own logic, they can be philosophical if you choose to define philosophy that way. I simply don’t. And the objective truth is that nothing forces either of us to define philosophy in any particular way.

Sometimes we have to shift perspectives just to understand each other. Beyond languages of information, there are languages of perspective and context. Sometimes someone says one thing and you hear something completely different.

All this is to say that my lens on philosophy tries to stay honest about what is objective and what is a matter of perspective—and that begins with examining where my mind meets language, and where language meets the external world. This is one of the methods I use to create my philosophies.

You’ll notice a common theme in my approach: I justify why I choose the philosophies I do. No one creates philosophy for no reason. We do it because certain behaviors create certain outcomes. Whether someone should follow a philosophy depends entirely on personal morals and ethics. I’ll expand on that in my Philosophy of Ethics section, but for now, the simple truth is this:
I follow my philosophies because they help me survive.

Philosophy helps me stay at peace with the environment I grew up in, and with the mental context I developed through. Humanity didn’t begin with knowledge; we began with words describing physical concepts, and eventually logic shaped those words into something like poetry that benefited survival. At some point in the evolution of consciousness -for the western world this point is the ancient greeks, the Socratics— people realized there was a difference between belief and knowledge. That realization holds a special place in the evolution of consciousness because it’s the moment a conscious animal begins using nature intentionally for its own benefit.

We seek truth and accept truth because it helps us survive. That’s where I derive my personal use of philosophy.

# Structure Without Structure

We can debate forever about what a meaningful life is. For some people it’s meeting expectations; for others it’s accepting that life never will. Some think meaning is seeking truth; others think it’s running from it. Some want peace; others want excitement. Some want moderation; some want martyrdom.

I’d say meaning is being okay with the world no matter what—sometimes being okay with not being okay. I might say it’s resilience to death. I recognize the absurd fact that nothing dictates what I should do, that no objective rights or wrongs exist, and that this itself is an objective truth that can be hard to live with. My philosophy of philosophy tries to accept what’s true—even when it disrupts my ability to create structure—by accepting that no objective structure exists in the first place.

So where does my structure come from? There is no universal structure in the world except for chaos. The lack of structure is the structure of the world to base your life on. Living things down to the cell function through preserving the state of the self, to a continuity of experience, unless deemed that for some reason, the end of life provides more value to life, or the absence of it. To say for now, it comes from wanting to live. The structure of life is remaining resilient to the chaos forcing the structure that is you to become one with it; Structureless That’s a value I derived from my own circumstances. I don’t want to die; I want to live. Not everyone feels that way, and even some who do value something else even more—enough to choose death for it, whether that’s dying for a country or dying as a revolutionary. I will later explore this subject more in my Philosophies of Life, Death, and Reproduction.

For now, let's keep things simple. I create philosophy to give my life structure based on the values I’ve derived from living through and surviving against natural circumstances. I try to stay aware of those values, why I formed them, and the fact they’re subjective. But the circumstances that formed them are enough justification for me to build philosophies that respond to those circumstances. This is how I form a relationship with nature, and with philosophy.

I understand nature by understanding the conditions I live under, by understanding myself, and by understanding the human condition. Through understanding nature, I can better predict the future by recognizing patterns. The more objective knowledge I gain, the more accurate my predictions become. The more accurate the predictions, the more I can act intentionally—bending the world in ways that help me get the consequences I want, based on the personal values I’ve derived.

A fulfilling life to me is one full of development, growth, strength, resilience, and overcoming my environment—while staying true to my own nature. My life is an artwork, and I am the artist. I paint whatever I believe belongs on the canvas. I live by my own rules, on my own terms. I aim to gain power over myself before anything else, and influence others by teaching them to do the same. Maybe that influence appears during my life; maybe afterward.

I suppose I just aspire to live true to my *Nature*.
