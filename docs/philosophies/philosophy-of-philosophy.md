# Philosophy of Philosophy

I think the dictionary does a really bad job at defining philosophy in a way that we actually use the word in our day-to-day language. The dictionary tries to define it under scholarly means, and addresses this "fun" little problem philosophers like to address in philosophy, is defining philosophy itself. "What is philosophy?".

It's hard to really address my perspective on philosophy without first addressing, im not pretending there's an objective definition of what "philosophy" is. "What is philosophy" is not a philosophical problem, it's a linguistic one. You can't answer that question objectively without first asking if there is some objective deciding factor that dictates the definition of anything. You can say it's our natural use of the word, but the same sound may appear with different meanings aross not only different languages, but also within the same language.

The point im getting at is, language is subjective, and there are things within these pages which I will be arguing are purely objective, but that some of the philosophies I decide on are decided based on personal, relative, or subjective values. In this case, my definition of philosophy and my way of utilizing philosophy is personal to me. What philosophy means to someone may differ from person to person.

In context of my writings here, every page and subject will begin with "Philosophy of", because I look at philosophy as a process of creating processes. I derive this from the way we use the term "philosophy" in language.

"I have a philosophy for living."
"I have a philosophy for cleaning"
"He has a philosophy for organization"
"She has a philosophy of writing"

In my personal context, I describe philosophy as "A way of going about doing something" or "A method to approahing a particular task or subject". In this article, I am writing about my personal Philosophy for philosophy, which is that I use it to create methods for preMEDITATING responses to particular aspects of life in respects to certain TRUTHS about it.

I do not treat the subject of TRUTH as something mystical as many passed philosophers have. I would like to think im a bit like Nietzsche on this subject, though would also like to think im a bit more structured and methodological in my meditations around relativity. I am not denying that there are objective truths in the universe, and I won't deny it has been an important and central subject to philosophy for mellenia. By my relationship to truth more strongly relates to its evolutionary uses rather than some deeper obsession with knowing some grand universal theory of everything. That job sort of belongs more to physicists today.

I want to reserve a whole section for my philosophies of truth and epistemology, but I couldn't write a segment on my philosophy of philosophy without discussing my personal relationship to one of philosophy's central subjects, and how I utilize truth when I compose philosophy. Most philosophers throughout history have approached subjects like truth, and life and death from the perspective of seeking truth first, and that that is what philosophy is, but I argue each of them were taking things from the perspective that those answers would be handed to them by the external world. When, questions lke "What is lovee?", "What is truth?", "What is life?", "What is death?", were really linguistic problems, not philosophical ones. This is weird to say, because by my own logic, they CAN be philosophical problems, if that is what you choose o perceive and define philosophy to be. This is not how I define or utilize philosophy, and the OBJECTIVE TRUTH here is that there is no objective deciding factor that says either one of us have to perceive philosophy in any particular way.

From time to time, we may have to shift our perspective a bit, so we can understand a person we're communicating with, because outside languages of information, there's also languages of perspective and context. Sometimes when a person says something, you may hear something completely different conceptually than what that person is trying to say.

All this to say that my lens of philosophy attempts to be VERY truthful to what is objective and what is perspective in the world and that starts with addressing where my mind meets language and language meets my external world. You could say this is one of the methods I go about creating my philosophies with.

A common theme you'll find in my philosophies, is the justificationa behind WHY I choose to live by the philosophies I do. We don't create philosophy for no reason. We do it because we realize that behaving in certain ways yields certain rewards. The question of why anyone should follow any philosophy is a question of personal morals and ethics, it depends on what your values are. I'll elaborate more on that on my Philosophy of Ethics segment. But for now, I think it will be safe to start by stating in the simplest way that I can why I follow my philosophies of philosophies.

The reason I do philosophy for the reasons I do, is because it's beneficial to my survival. They allow me to remain at peace with the environment I grew up in, in continuity within the context my mind developed through. Humanity didn't start with knowledge, we started with words of physical concept, and before logic created poetry out of them that somehow was beneficial to survival. At some point in history, in context of the western world, that would be ancient Greek society with the pre-socratics, man-kind realized that there is a difference between what is belief, and what is known. This realization has a special place in the evolution of consciousness, because survivalistically it is what begins the journey to a conscious animals path to truly using nature for its own benefit.

We seek truth, and we accept what is true, because it allows us to use that truth to the benefit of our own survival. This realization is where I derive my personal use of philosophy.

We could fight for hours on what the definition of a meaningful life is. In some cases it's living up to your expectations, in some cases it's accepting that life will never meet those expectations, sometimes it can be seeking truth, sometimes it can be running from it. Some people will define it as peaceful, others will define it as exciting that peace is boring. Some will say its a moderation of both, some will say it's dying for what you believe in.

I would say, it's being okay with the world no matter what, I would say sometimes its being okay with not being okay. I might say it's being resilient to death. I would acknowledge the absurd that there is nothing that dictates what I should do in life, that there is nothing to dictate objective rights and wrongs, and that that is an objective truth that is hard to live with. My philosophy of philosophy tries to accept and live with everything true, even if that truth disrupts my ability to create structure, by accepting the fact that there is nothing objective to live life by.

So where does my structure come from? For now it comes from wanting to live. Because that is a value I derived through the nature of my own circumstanes. I don't want to die, I want to live. That may not always be that way, because not everyone wants to live, and some people want to live, but value something else more enough to choose death. Perhaps dying for your country, or perhaps choose to die as a revolutionary standing by what you truly believe in.

I create philosophy to give my life structure, based on the values I've derived living through natural circumstane. I try to be aware of those values I form, and what lead me to form them, while acknowledge their subjectivty. The natural circumstances that I derived those values through are often times enough justification for me to want to live by a philosophy in respect to those circumstances exist. This is how i form a relationship with nature, and thus with philosophy.

I understand nature by understanding the circumstances I exist under, by understanding myself and the human condition. By understanding nature, I can more accurately make predictions about the future through recognizing patterns. Those predictions of the future get more accurate with the more objective knowledge I wield of the world around me. The more accurate my predictions, the more I can account for in my decision make so that I may bend the world through my actions to acquire the things and consequences I want to live my life with based on the person values I derived by living my life.

A fulfilling life to me is one packed with plenty of personal development, growth, become strong, dominant and overcoming to my environment, while being true to the nature of myself, and being an individual expression of the absurd circumstance human lifes lives through. I will make my life an art, a personal painting, and I shall paint on this canvas whatever I feel is right to be painted. I live by my own rules, live by my own means. I will gain power over myself above my environment and I will gain influence by teaching others to do the same. Perhaps that influence will come in my life time, perhaps it will come sometime after.

I aspire to be my own Ubermesnche and these are the values that guide why I do philosophy the way I do.
These are my philosophies of Philosophies.
