# Oddly's Notebook

This is my public notebook where I jot down my thoughts, ideas, and experiments. Feel free to explore and learn more about what I'm working on!

## Architecture Pages
The pages under the "Architecture" section provide various software architecture documnets that I use to document software decisions. I also use the documents as prompts in my AI-assisted design process.
